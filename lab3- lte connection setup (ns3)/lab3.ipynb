    "This lab intends to explore the LTE architecture and the attachment procedure for a user equipment (UE). The lab starts with an introduction of the LTE architecture followed by the attachment process itself encompassing different connection stages as UE initiates its connection with the LTE network. Afterwards, a simulation encompassing different connection establishment and attachment processes is implemented using ns-3 LTE simulator. The students will be encouraged to design their own LTE radio access network (RAN) topologies using React app discussed in detail in Lab0. A summary of the lab objectives is provided as below:\n",

The S1 interface is the connection between the RAN and EPC utilized for the LTE services such as traditional calling, voice over IP (VoIP) and dedicated data access towards the internet. It has two different interface types based on utilization by the user plane and control plane protocols. S1-U is used for user plane and S1-AP for the application or control plane. In addition any signaling between RAN and EPC is also carried via S1. EPC has its own interfaces for performing different management functions related to the LTE processes such as mobility and location management or user information management.<br>\n",
