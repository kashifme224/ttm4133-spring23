    "# Lab 2. Exploring Attach and Default Bearer Activation\n",
    "***\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "***\n",
    "In this lab we will look into the bearer activation when the User Equipment (UE) connects to LTE. An attach procedure occurs whenever a UE is turned on and connects to LTE. The following procedure shows how the Default EPS Bearer (the tunnel between UE and PDN-GW) is configured. At a higher level, the successful attachment to the network infrastructure corresponds to a UE getting an IP address, which allows the mobile device to utilize the services offered by the network.\n",

    "## 1.1 Learning Objectives\n",
    "This lab focuses towards the following learning goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observing the protocols and packet communication in an Attach procedure.\n",
    "- Understanding the separation of control and user plane communications.\n",
    "- Comparing the observed attach procedure with theoretical concepts.\n",

Following that, the eNodeB sends the Response message to the MME as an acknowledgement, including the Tunnel Endpoint Identity (TEID) used by Serving-GW, and the address of the eNodeB;\n",
